The First Denoising Step: Guided by your prompt, the AI looks at the field of noise and asks, 'What tiny change can I make to this noise to make it look a little bit less like random static, and a little bit more like an astronaut on a horse?' It then makes a very small adjustment.\n4.  Iterate, Iterate, Iterate: The AI repeats this process dozens of times. With each step, the image becomes a little less noisy and a little more coherent. Faint shapes begin to emerge from the static. You might see the rough outline of a helmet, or the curve of a horse's back.\n5.  The Final Image: After a set number of steps (e.g., 20 to 50), the denoising process is complete.
