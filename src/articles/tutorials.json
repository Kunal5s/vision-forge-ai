        "content": "1.  **Generate a 'Blank Slate' Product:** First, you'll generate a photo of the product *without* any branding. Your prompt would be something like: `Photorealistic photo of a blank, generic, matte white soda can sitting on a table. Professional product photography.`\n2.  **Import and Place Your Design:** Take the best image from that generation and open it in your editing software. Now, import your actual product label (e.g., your Zen tea logo PNG file) and place it as a new layer over the blank can. You'll need to use transform tools (like 'warp' or 'perspective') to make your flat label realistically wrap around the curved surface of the can.\n3.  **The Magic of Blending:** This is the key step. Your placed label might look a bit 'stuck on.' To fix this, you can use AI. Make a loose selection around your label and use a Generative Fill prompt like 'realistically blend the label onto the can, matching the lighting and texture.' The AI will analyze the lighting of the original photo and add subtle shadows and highlights to your label, making it look like it was physically there during the photoshoot."

Use Generative Fill to create realistic shadows underneath your product to seamlessly blend it into the environment."
