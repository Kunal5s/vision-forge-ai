    "keyTakeaways": [
      "AI allows architects to go from a text description to a photorealistic concept render in seconds.",
      "Use AI to rapidly explore different material options, like wood, concrete, or marble, on a 3D model.",
      "Instantly test various lighting conditions, such as 'golden hour' or 'nighttime,' on your design.",
      "The 'image-to-image' workflow, which uses a simple 'clay render' as a guide, is key to this process.",
      "Use generative fill (inpainting) to quickly add realistic people, trees, and cars to your scene.",
      "Use outpainting to expand your render and show the building in its wider neighborhood context."

    "conclusion": "The architect's drafting table has just become infinite. The barrier between a design idea and a stunning, client-ready visualization has all but disappeared. By embracing these AI tools, designers and architects can work more creatively, more collaboratively, and more efficiently than ever before, truly building the future at the speed of thought."
